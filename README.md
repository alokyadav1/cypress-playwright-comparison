# Cypress vs. Playwright: Strategic Guide 2025-2026

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive, web-based comparison tool designed to help QA engineers and engineering leaders make informed decisions between the two leading web automation frameworks: **Cypress** and **Playwright**.

The guide provides a deep-dive into the technical and strategic differences between both tools, presented through a modern, interactive dashboard featuring performance charts, technical breakdowns, and architectural insights.

## Key Comparison Areas

- **2025–2026 Technical Comparison**: A deep-dive data table analyzing Architecture, Browser Support, Parallelization, AI Readiness, and more with embedded third-party sources.
- **Strategic Use Cases**: Dedicated analysis on when to choose Cypress (DX focus, Component Testing) vs. Playwright (Enterprise Scale, Cross-browser parity).
- **Cucumber & BDD Support**: Native vs. community-driven implementations.
- **Architectural Rift**: "In-Browser" (Cypress) vs. "Out-of-Process" (Playwright) runtime models.
- **Performance & Concurrency**: Free parallelism vs. Cloud-based orchestration.
- **Debugging Workflow**: Time-travel debugging vs. Playwright's Trace Viewer.
- **Presentation Hub**: Integrated PDF viewer for full-screen slide decks and high-fidelity infographics.
- **TCO Matrix**: Long-term ROI factors, parallelization costs, and learning curves.

## Technical Implementation

- **Frontend**: Built with Vanilla HTML/JS and CSS.
- **Styling**: Utilizes **Tailwind CSS** for a premium, modern design system.
- **Data Visualization**: Uses **Chart.js** to provide clear benchmarks on browser support and execution performance.
- **Typography**: Features **Inter** from Google Fonts for enhanced readability.
